# Week-1-Challenge

The aim for this project was to make sure the client had recieved what they asked for, where the client wanted codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their own site is optimized for search engines, which i did, including a descripitive title.

I made sure that my project matched the criteria meaning the that the HTML elements were semantically correct, making sure that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, this projects falls into sequel order and there is clearly a descriptive title.
